# JavaScript Utility Suite

A lightweight, browser-based toolset featuring a mathematical calculator and a NATO phonetic alphabet converter. Built with vanilla JavaScript to demonstrate core DOM manipulation, event handling, and algorithm implementation without external dependencies.

## 🛠 Features

### 1. Mathematical Calculator
* **Arithmetic Operations:** Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* **Input Validation:** Prevents invalid inputs to ensure calculation stability.
* **History Tracking:** Dynamically renders a history log of recent calculations using DOM manipulation.

### 2. NATO Phonetic Converter
* **Real-time Conversion:** Instantly translates input text into the NATO phonetic alphabet (e.g., "Hello" → "Hotel Echo Lima Lima Oscar").
* **Case Insensitivity:** robustly handles mixed uppercase and lowercase input.
* **String Parsing:** specific algorithm to map characters to phonetic values.
